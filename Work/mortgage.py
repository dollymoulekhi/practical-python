# Dave has decided to take out a 30-year fixed rate mortgage of $500,000 with Guidoâ€™s Mortgage, 
# Stock Investment, and Bitcoin trading corporation. 
# The interest rate is 5% and the monthly payment is $2684.11.

# Here is a program that calculates the total amount that Dave will have to pay over the life of the mortgage:

total_pay=500000
monthly_pay=2684.11
i=0
total_payed=0
while total_pay> 0:
    i=i+1
    
    intrest_pay=total_pay*5/1200
    remaining_mon=monthly_pay - intrest_pay
    total_pay=total_pay-remaining_mon
    total_payed=monthly_pay*i
print(total_payed)
