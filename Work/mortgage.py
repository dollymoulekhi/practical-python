# mortgage.py
# Dave has decided to take out a 30-year fixed rate mortgage of $500,000 with Guidoâ€™s Mortgage, 
# Stock Investment, and Bitcoin trading corporation. 
# The interest rate is 5% and the monthly payment is $2684.11.

# Here is a program that calculates the total amount that Dave will have to pay over the life of the mortgage:

# Exercise 1.8: Extra payments
# Suppose Dave pays an extra $1000/month for the first 12 months of the mortgage?
# Modify the program to incorporate this extra payment and have it print the total amount paid along with the 
# number of months required.
# When you run the new program, it should report a total payment of 929,965.62 over 342 months.

# Exercise 1.9: Making an Extra Payment Calculator
# Modify the program so that extra payment information can be more generally handled. 
# Make it so that the user can set these variables:

# Exercise 1.10: Making a table
# Modify the program to print out a table showing the month, 
# total paid so far, and the remaining principal. The output should look something like this:
